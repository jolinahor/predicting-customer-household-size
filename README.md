# Predicting Customer Household Size from Purchasing Behavior Using Machine Learning Models

This project uses purchase histories from 5,027 U.S. Amazon customers (2018–2022, 1.8M+ transactions) to build regression and tree-based models for predicting customer household size. Exploratory data analysis and feature engineering are combined with linear, regularized, random forest, and gradient boosted models to capture behavioral patterns linked to household composition.

[This project was completed for a Kaggle regression competition for UCLA’s STATS 101C Course - Introduction to Statistical Modeling and Data Mining.]
